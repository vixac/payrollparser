This is a simple parser of the tabbed output of the Payroll system in question.
Requirements:
- node.js
- tsc

How to use:
- run build.sh to create tabby.js from typescript/tabby.ts
- move your input tabbed file into files/input.txt
- run run.sh
- your output file is stored in files/input.csv
- Thank Alan Turing for both creating the cause and the solution to all your problems.
