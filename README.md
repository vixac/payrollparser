This is a simple parser of the tabbed output of the Payroll system in question.
Heres how you use it:

- run "tsc payroll.ts" to generate payroll.js
- copy payroll.js  into http://rextester.com/l/nodejs_online_compiler
- copy your payroll output tabbed text into the Input section on the website, (just above the Run It button).
- Press Run it.
- The output is CSV text. Copy it and paste it into a new file with the .csv extension.
- Open your new file in excel
- Thank Alan Turing for both creating the cause and the solution to all your problems.
